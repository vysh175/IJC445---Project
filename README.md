# Passenger Rail Performance Visualisation (IJC445)

This repository contains the R code and composite visualisation developed for the IJC445 Data Visualisation coursework.

## Project Overview
The project explores passenger rail performance in Great Britain using publicly available data from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR). It focuses on two key performance metrics:
- Public Performance Measure (PPM)
- Cancelled and Significantly Late services (CaSL)

The visualisations examine punctuality, service disruption, variability, and differences across selected rail operators.

## Files in this repository
- `rail_performance_visualisation.R` – R script used to clean the data and generate all visualisations
- `IJC445_composite_visualisation.png` – Composite visualisation (Figure 1) used in the coursework report
